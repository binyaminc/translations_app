# translations_app
 
Experimental application for language learning.

Users can create lists they want to learn (and delete/update them). The application is based on [Firebase database](https://firebase.google.com/), so one can send a link of his list to other users (via whatsapp or other means), and recieve lists using list links from other users.


## How to use
1. Download the app in [this link](https://github.com/binyaminc/translations_app/raw/main/app/release/app-release.apk)
(Alternatively, you could clone or download the project and run the app on an emulator, but it's unnecessarily complicated)
2. Register with your email username and some new password (not necessarily the email's password) 
3. Use it :)

**_NOTE:_** Originally the application was designed to have 2 types of users - teachers and students. Teachers have the ability to share their lists, and should have paid money. Students cannot send their lists, and didn't have to pay. Eventually I didn't take money from the teachers, but that's the reason one should choose 'teacher' or 'student' in the registration.

# translations_app
 
Experimential application for language learning.

Users can create lists they want to learn (and delete/update them). The application is based on [Firebase database](https://firebase.google.com/), so one can send a link of his list to other users and recieve lists using list links from other users.


## How to use
Download the app in [this link](https://github.com/binyaminc/translations_app/raw/main/app/release/app-release.apk)
(Alternatively, you could clone or download the project and run the app on an emulator, but it's unnecessarily complicated)

**_NOTE:_** originally the application was designed to have 2 types of users - teachers that have the ability to send links to their lists, which should have cost money, and students who cannot send their lists, in free. Eventually I didn't take money for the option of "teacher", but that's the reason one should choose in the registration.
